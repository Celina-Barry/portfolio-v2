#This is a website dedicated to my project portfolio
## goal:
Use a format of a website to experiment in different animation techniques and to showcase some of my recent projects.

## notable animations:
- sinkhole effects on homepage
- bubble animations on contact and marketo pages
- slide-in and falling animations on About page
- button animations
- spinning header icons 
- and more

## stuff that failed:
- react component that applied animations to follow a user's mouse around the page that revealed text underneath

## Styling
Used styled components with a simple color scheme applied across all pages.
